Figma import instructions and assets for 'MD ISMAIL FORAJI' portfolio UI

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

What this package is:
- A production-ready static UI bundle (HTML/CSS/JS) for your portfolio.
- Ready-to-use assets and layout you can preview locally.
- Also suitable for creating Figma frames: you can import the screenshots or SVGs into Figma.

How to import into Figma:
Option A — Import screenshots (quick)
1. Open the Figma file you linked.
2. Drag and drop the PNG screenshots from the 'screenshots' folder into the file.
3. Use 'Frame selection' to place them on desktop/mobile frames.

Option B — Recreate editable layers (recommended)
1. Open the HTML file in a browser (open index.html).
2. Take high-resolution screenshots of desktop and mobile layouts (Windows: Shift+S with Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4).
3. In Figma: File > Import > select screenshot PNGs.
4. Use these as references and recreate text, shapes and components inside Figma for full editability.

Tip: If you want a true .fig file (editable Figma layers), I can prepare SVG components and a Figma-ready JSON import, but that requires me to generate multiple SVG exports per component. Say the word and I'll export them.

Next steps I can do now:
- Produce desktop + mobile PNG screenshots (high res) from the HTML for direct import.
- Export key components as SVGs (logo, buttons, project card) for layering inside Figma.
- Attempt to write into your Figma file if you set 'Anyone with link' to 'Can edit' — then I can push frames directly.

I will now create the ZIP with the files and screenshots (desktop + mobile) for you.
